## Roadmap

- Add dates to the Cities that are populated by the Artist/Band search.

- Add a map that loads when you select a local brewery with the locations of the populated local breweries as well as the event location.

- Add "Sold Out" icon if tickets for the show are no longer available.

- Add functionality to our "About" clickable in the navbar. Link to another HTML page with information: Story, Contact Info, Colaborator Info, etc.

- Add a function to allow the user to cycle through both shows and breweries 5 at a time.

- Continue to refine the site and search for any other issues that arise.
